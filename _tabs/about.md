Hi!

I'm Marcus Rognes, an experienced Full Stack Developer and Consultant with more than 11 years of experience.

Throughout my career, I've worked on a wide range of projects, including websites, mobile and web apps, CRM systems, news platforms, eCommerce platforms, APIs. and large digitalization processes. 

From the initial planning phase to the final release and ongoing maintenance, I have hands-on experience in every stage of the project lifecycle. 

Aside from my professional pursuits, I'm passionate about playing and making games and music, 

This website will serve as my platform to share my thoughts through blogging, provide resources, and perhaps even showcase some game demos! 

Please keep in mind that this page is still a work in progress, and more updates will be coming soon.
